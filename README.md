# ML-DL-Algorithm-notes
## Purpose:
This repository lists the supplementary notes and documents during my machine learning and deep learning process.

# Part 1: Machine Learning techniques from scratch:
### [1. Decision Tree: implementation of decision tree from scratch ](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Decision_Tree_from_scratch_to_complete.ipynb)

### [2. KNN: implementation of KNN from scratch](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/KNN-supervised_Learning_from%20scratch%20.ipynb)

### [3. KMeans: implementation of KMeans from scratch](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/K-%20Means%20from%20scratch.ipynb)

### [4. PCA: implementation of PCA from scratch](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/PCA%20from%20scratch.ipynb)

# Part 2: Data preprocessing and measurements for model performance
### [1. Data preprocessing & feature engineering necessary for ML projects](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Data_Preprocessing_%26_Feature_Engineering.ipynb)

### [2. ROC_AUC_Confusion_Matrix](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/ROC_AUC_Confusion_Matrix.ipynb)

# Part 3: Loading data:
### [1. How to import data from kaggle & organize train_validation_test dataset](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/How_to_import_data_from_Kaggle_%26_organize_train_validation_test_folders.ipynb)
### 2. Import datasets from sklearn in-built function
- e.g. from sklearn.datasets import wine

# Part 4: Other algorithms
### [1. Newton Method algorithm](https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Newton_Method.ipynb)
