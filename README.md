# ML-DL-Algorithm-notes
## Purpose:
This repository lists all the supplementary notes and documents during my machine learning and deep learning process.

## Part One: Machine Learning notes:
#### 1. Decision Tree: realization of decision tree from scratch 
[https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Decision_Tree_from_scratch_to_complete.ipynb]

#### 2. PCA: realization of PCA from scratch
#### 3. Newton Method algorithm
[https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Newton_Method.ipynb]
#### 4. Data preprocessing & feature engineering necessary for ML projects
[https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Data_Preprocessing_%26_Feature_Engineering.ipynb]

## Part Two: Loading data:
#### 1. How to import data from kaggle & organize train_validation_test dataset
