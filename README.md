#### 2. Decision Tree: realization of decision tree from scratch 
[https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/Decision_Tree_from_scratch_to_complete.ipynb]

### 3. KNN: realization of KNN from scratch
[https://github.com/xslittlemaggie/Other-ML-DL-Algorithm-notes/blob/master/KNN-supervised_Learning_from%20scratch%20.ipynb]

#### 4. PCA: realization of PCA from scratch

#### 5. Newton Method algorithm
